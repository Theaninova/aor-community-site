# How to

Use the [Unity Asset Ripper](https://github.com/AssetRipper/AssetRipper)
to extract all game files first

Set the following options:

* Mesh Export Format: `GLB`
* Image Export Format: `Png`
* Terrain Export Format: `Yaml`
* Sprite Export Format: `Yaml`

Create a `.env.local` with `GAME_DUMP_PATH` pointing to the `artofrally` dump folder.
